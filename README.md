# Snobol3 Interpreter in Java

Snobol3 has always held a special fascination for me. It was the
first language I learned (after FORTRAN), and it was the first
language for which I built a partial interpreter for the IBM
1620 computer in about 1969. I recently (2005) found my old copy
of the Snobol 3 Primer, and since I had some time on my hands, I
decided write an interpreter for it in Java.
